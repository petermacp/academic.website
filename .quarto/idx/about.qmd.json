I have over 20 years of experience in researching and addressing health disparities, with a particular focus on the epidemiology of infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. \n\nMy research spans various global contexts, with a special emphasis on low- and middle-income countries, where I work on developing and improving disease surveillance systems, diagnostics, and prevention strategies. I hold a prestigious NIHR Global Health Research Professorship and lead a Wellcome Discovery Award-funded programme focused on advancing novel methods for tuberculosis surveillance and prevention. In addition, my team and I are committed to shaping global health policy through our collaborations with international organizations such as the WHO and UNAIDS.\n\n### Current Appointments\n- Professor of Global Public Health, University of Glasgow, UK\n- Head of Public Health, University of Glasgow, UK\n- Honorary Professor of Population Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, UK\n- Honorary Consultant in Communicable Disease Control, Public Health Scotland\n\n### Research Interests\n- **Infectious Disease Epidemiology:** Particularly HIV and tuberculosis in low- and middle-income countries.\n- **Global Health Policy:** Advising on policy development to improve health outcomes in high-burden settings.\n- **Health Systems Strengthening:** Focus on diagnostics, surveillance, and prevention strategies.\n- **Global Health Funding & Programmes:** Leadership of major international research programmes, including substantial funding from organizations like the Wellcome Trust and NIHR.\n\n### Key current research grants\n- **NIHR Global Health Research Professorship** (2024 – 2029)\n- **Wellcome Discovery Award** for research into novel tuberculosis surveillance and prevention methods (2024 – 2028)\n\n### Current Projects\nI currently lead several major international initiatives focusing on global health and infectious diseases.
