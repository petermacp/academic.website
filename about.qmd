## Biography

I am Professor of Global Public Health at the University of Glasgow, where I lead research at the intersection of infectious disease epidemiology, global health, and health systems strengthening. I have over 20 years of experience in researching and addressing health disparities, with a particular focus on the epidemiology of infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. 

My research spans various global contexts, with a special emphasis on low- and middle-income countries, where I work on developing and improving disease surveillance systems, diagnostics, and prevention strategies. I hold a prestigious NIHR Global Health Research Professorship and lead a Wellcome Discovery Award-funded programme focused on advancing novel methods for tuberculosis surveillance and prevention. In addition, my team and I are committed to shaping global health policy through our collaborations with international organizations such as the WHO and UNAIDS.
